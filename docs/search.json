In this course, we are going\nto focus on the core concepts of machine learning that beginning ML\nresearchers must know. We will cover ‘classical machine learning’\nprimarily using R, and explore some applications to environmental\nscience. To understand broader concepts of artificial intelligence or\ndeep learning, a strong fundamental knowledge of machine learning is\nindispensable.\nTeaching team\nInstructor: Mateo Robbins (mjrobbins@ucsb.edu)\nOffice: NCEAS Group Office\nOffice hours: Monday 11:00-12:00\nTeaching assistant: TBD\nOffice:\nOffice hours:\nImportant links\nLink\nto full course syllabus\nLink to Code of Conduct (Bren / UCSB)\nLink to course GitHub Classroom, other essential\nresources\nWeekly course schedule\nLectures: M, W 9:30 - 10:45am PST (NCEAS)\nLearning objectives\nThe goal of EDS 232 is to equip students with a strong foundation in\nthe core concepts of machine learning. By the end of the course,\nstudents should be able to: \nBuild machine learning models in R using popular machine learning\npackages\nBuild and train supervised machine learning models for prediction\nand binary classification tasks, including linear and logistic\nregression.\nApply best practices for machine learning development so that\nyour models generalize to data and tasks in the real world.\nBuild and use decision trees and tree ensemble methods, including\nrandom forests and boosted trees.\nUse unsupervised learning techniques for unsupervised learning:\nincluding clustering and anomaly detection.\nCourse requirements\nComputing\nMinimum device requirements\nSoftware requirements\nAccount requirements\nTextbook\nRequired textbook / information\nOther requirements\nAnything else\nImportant for students to know\nTentative topics\nWeek\nLecture topics\n1\nIntroduction, ML Modeling Fundamentals I\n2\nLinear Regression, ML Modeling Fundamentals II\n3\nLogistic and Regularized Regression\n4\nK Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees\n5\nRandom Forests, Gradient Boosting\n6\nK-Means and Hierarchical Clustering\n7\nEthics, Justice, Bias\n8\nDeep Learning and Support Vectors\n9\nTBD\n\n\n\n",
