In this course, we focus on\nthe core concepts of machine learning that beginning ML researchers must\nknow. We cover ‘classical machine learning’ primarily using R, and\nexplore applications to environmental science. To understand broader\nconcepts of artificial intelligence or deep learning, a strong\nfundamental knowledge of machine learning is indispensable.\nTeaching team\nInstructor: Mateo Robbins (mjrobbins@ucsb.edu)\nOffice: NCEAS Group Office\nOffice hours: Monday 11:00-12:00\nTeaching assistant: Brian Lee\n(brianlee52@bren.ucsb.edu)\nOffice:\nOffice hours:\nImportant links\nLink\nto full course syllabus\nWeekly course schedule\nLectures: M, W 9:30 - 10:45am PST (NCEAS)\nLearning objectives\nThe goal of EDS 232 is to equip students with a strong foundation in\nthe core concepts of machine learning. By the end of the course,\nstudents should be able to: \nBuild machine learning models in R using popular machine learning\npackages\nBuild and train supervised machine learning models for prediction\nand binary classification tasks, including linear and logistic\nregression.\nApply best practices for machine learning development so that\nyour models generalize to data and tasks in the real world.\nBuild and use decision trees and tree ensemble methods, including\nrandom forests and boosted trees.\nUse unsupervised learning techniques for unsupervised learning:\nincluding clustering.\nCourse requirements\nComputing\nMinimum\nMEDS device requirements\nR version 4.0.2 (or higher)\nRStudio version 1.4.1103 (or higher)\nTextbook\nHands-On Machine\nLearning with R, by Bradley Boehmke and Brandon Greenwell\n\nTentative topics\nWeek\nLecture topics\n1\nIntroduction, ML Modeling Fundamentals I\n2\nLinear Regression, ML Modeling Fundamentals II\n3\nLogistic and Regularized Regression\n4\nK Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees\n5\nRandom Forests, Gradient Boosting\n6\nK-Means and Hierarchical Clustering\n7\nEthics, Justice, Bias\n8\nDeep Learning and Support Vectors\n9\nTBD\n\n\n\n",
